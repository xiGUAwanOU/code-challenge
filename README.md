# code-challenge

Task: Implement a simple web app that allows one to browse the Imgur gallery using https://api.imgur.com/:
* [x] Show gallery images in a grid of thumbnails and lazy load them
* [x] Show image description in the thumbnail, top or bottom
* [x] On clicking an image in the gallery, show its details: big image, title, description, upvotes, downvotes, and score

Filters:
* [x] Filter the images based on: hot, top, user
* [x] Include or exclude viral images from the result set
* [x] Filter based on window and sort parameters;

Bonus points:
* [x] Using React or Vue, the last one would be preferred
* [ ] Unit testing (only done for services, no time for testing the views but I'd like to do it if I have time)
* [x] Have a mobile-first approach
* [x] Make the App accessible for anyone
