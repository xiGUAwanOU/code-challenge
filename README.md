# code-challenge

Task: Implement a simple web app that allows one to browse the Imgur gallery using https://api.imgur.com/:
* Show gallery images in a grid of thumbnails and lazy load them
* Show image description in the thumbnail, top or bottom
* On clicking an image in the gallery, show its details: big image, title, description, upvotes, downvotes, and score

Filters:
* Filter the images based on: hot, top, user
* Include or exclude viral images from the result set
* Filter based on window and sort parameters;

Bonus points:
* Using React or Vue, the last one would be preferred
* Unit testing
* Have a mobile-first approach
* Make the App accessible for anyone
